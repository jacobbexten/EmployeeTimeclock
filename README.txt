Employee Time Clock App designed for a workplace where employees can sign up and make an account, then clock in or out. They will then be able to look at existing entries for the day and also past entries. They will also be able to request time off and have their request posted to a calendar where everyone will be able to see who requested time off before them or not. The admin (manager) is able to view everyone's clock ins and outs unlike the user (employee) who can only view their entries.
